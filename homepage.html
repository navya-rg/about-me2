			Flipping through the pages of my life, I find myself watching my father in amazement when he talks about his work. Growing up in a family full of engineers developed my interest in the field. Being a keen observer with an inquisitive nature is what I am. There were nights when I used to keep pondering over questions and could not sleep without my curiosity satisfied. They were like bed time stories. Once my elder brother showed me how a fan works with a motor from a toy car. This made me open up all toys that worked on battery. I realized how simple everything was with a bit of understanding. I loved working with my hands and throughout my childhood I made a lot of things that today I realize uses concepts from Sciences. Creating new technology to make life simpler is something I aspire to do.

			My introduction to computers at quite an early age helped in computer science always being an area of interest for me. My passion for music, art and sports developed over the years I spent in one of the best schools in the country, The Lawrence School, Lovedale. I have represented my school in basketball tournaments. I had an opportunity to visit a high school in South Korea and it provided me with a lot of insight into their educational system. I understood that it was a lot more stressful than mine. To be at the top consistently takes a lot of effort. I had to keep myself motivated at all times.  As I don't need someone to encourage or push me to do something, I decided to compete real hard with myself. I keep setting targets for myself and work towards achieving them. My success motivated me and my failure didn't discourage me.

			After I finished my schooling, I ended up in VIT, Vellore in the branch of Electronics and communication. As my rank was not good enough, I did not get the course of my choice which was Computer Science and Engineering. So, I decided to work really hard and migrate to Computer Science which was able to. I am currently in the junior year and I hope to continue studying further after my undergraduate. As basketball has always been driving force for me for the past couple of years, it helped me get into the University bsketball team and a chance to represent VIT in various tournaments.
